	  android:hardwareAccelerated="false"
	
	Definition : Beginning in Android 3.0 (API level 11), the Android 2D rendering pipeline supports hardware acceleration, 
					meaning that all drawing operations that are performed on a View's canvas use the GPU. Because of the increased resources 
					required to enable hardware acceleration, your app will consume more RAM.
				Hardware acceleration is enabled by default if your Target API level is >=14, but can also be explicitly enabled.
